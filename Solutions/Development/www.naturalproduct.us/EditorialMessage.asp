 The broad scientific scope of Natural Product Communications (NPC) means that we publish high quality papers across a wide spectrum of natural products research, including organic, medicinal, pharmaceutical, bioorganic, analytical, theoretical, biotechnological and chemotaxonomic aspects. We welcome all types of manuscripts: communications, full papers and reviews. We have a very diverse international authorship, and a readership that is continuously growing, as indicated by the increasing number of submissions and published papers, and also from the web statistics. NPC is a SCI-cited journal with an impact factor in 2015 of 0.884. <B> We would like to thank our authors, readers and referees who are the architects of this success. </b>  <br /> <br /> 
During March 2016, we published a themed issue dedicated to “Traditional Medicines as Sources of Bioactive Compounds (Guest Editors: Profs. Giovanni Vidari and Paola Vita Finzi)”. We had four honorarium issues to recognize internationally renowned natural product researchers, Prof. Dr Motto Tori, for his 65th Birthday (February 2016), Prof. Dr. DHC Yoshinori Asakawa, President of the Phytochemical Society of Asia, for his 75th Birthday (July and August 2016) and Prof. Dr Wilhelm Fleischhacker, for his 85th Birthday (October 2016). We are committed to placing this journal at the forefront for the dissemination of new and exciting natural products research. NPC will be proud to recognize eminent natural product scientists by dedicating an issue in their honour. Suggestions for themed and/or honorarium issue(s) would be welcomed. We look forward to receiving your submissions and your feedback. <br /> <br /> 
NPC in collaboration with the Phytochemical Society of Asia (PSA) organized an International Symposium on Natural Products for the Future 2016 (ISNPF2016) that was held between September 1-4, 2016 at Tokushima Bunri University, Tokushima, Japan. This attracted scientists, professionals and representatives of companies working in the exciting field of natural product research not only from Asia but also from all over the world. We have also planned a special NPC-ISNPF issue to be published during 2017. <br /> <br /> 
Professor Stefano Serra, National Research Council (CNR), Istituto di Chimica del Riconoscimento Molecolare (ICRM), Milano, Italy, won the 2015 “Gerald Blunden Award” for the best article “The Co-identity of Lipiarmycin A3 and Tiacumicin B” Natural Product Communications 9 (2) 237-240 (2014), and co-authored by Angelo Bedeschi, Piera Fonte, Giovanni Fronza, and Claudio Fuganti. The Award wins a free year's subscription to Natural Product Communications and is accompanied by US$ 500, sponsored by Natural Product Inc. The award was made for the best article published during the last two years (2014-2015). In 2017, the award will be made for the best review article published during 2015-2016. Each year, the winner will be announced in May at the time of Prof. Blunden’s Anniversary, and a similar pattern will be followed in consecutive years. <br /> <br /> 
For the information of our authors and readers, we have to announce some changes to the Editorial Board and Editorial Board of Advisors. Professor De-an Guo, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Shanghai 201203, P. R. China, has been an editor from the time of inception of the journal. He has expressed a wish to step down from his editorial role. His high level of commitment and expertise will be missed, and the editors and publisher thank him for his many valuable contributions. Leaving the Editorial Advisory Board are Professors Viqar Uddin Ahmad, Josep Coll, Imre Mathe and Luca Rastrelli; we thank them for their support and their service. We are, however, pleased to report that as of January 2017, Professor Ping-Jyun Sung, National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium Checheng, Pingtung 944, Taiwan, will be joining the Editorial Board, bringing considerable expertise and experience, particularly in marine natural products. Professors Norbert Arnold, Vassya Bankova and Lindros A. Skaltsounis will be joining the Editorial Advisory Board. We welcome them all and look forward to working with them. <br /> <br />

Natural Product Communications (NPC) invites research articles on all aspects of natural products including Isolation, Structure Elucidation, Spectroscopic Properties, Analytical Methods, Biosynthesis, Chemotaxonomy, Pharmacognosy, Chemical Ecology, Biodiversity, Biotransformations, Synthesis, Partial Synthesis, Structure-Activity Relationship, Fermentation and Tissue Culture. Thus, coverage of the journal spans practically all areas of fundamental chemical and biochemical research and could broadly be organized into following sections/subsections:
    <ol>
        <li>Accounts/Reviews/Invited Articles</li>
        <li>Short/Preliminary Communications</li>
        <li>Full papers, that will include:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Essential Oil/Perfumery Products</li>
                <li>Fermentation/Tissue Culture/Biotechnology</li>
                <li>Isolation/Characterization</li>
                <li>Chemotaxonomy/Chemical Ecology/Biodiversity</li>
                <li>Synthesis/Partial Synthesis</li>

        <li>Letters to Editor/Correspondence</li>
        <li>Book reviews together with notices of meetings concerned with natural products</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="paraHead">The contents of papers are the sole responsibility of the authors, and publication shall not imply the concurrence of the Editors or Publishers.</div><br />
Authors are invited to submit their full and comprehensive reviews, shorter reviews/accounts of recent developments in a particular field, to any member of the Editorial Board. Prior consultation with one of the editor is advised, however unsolicited reviews may be considered for publication.
Short/Preliminary Communications are for the purpose of rapidly publishing exceptionally important contributions; comprehensive papers with full experimental details would be subsequently reported. Authors must provide a covering letter detailing and justifying the request to have their manuscript considered in this subcategory.<br /><br />

<div class="paraHead">Conditions:</div><br />

Authors must accept full responsibility for the factual accuracy of the data presented and should obtain any authorization necessary for publication.<br />

Manuscripts will be considered for publication depending on the interest and value and with the understanding that they contain original unpublished work and are submitted exclusively to the journal Natural Product Communications. Manuscripts that report fragmentary parts of a larger study will be returned to the authors at the Editors' discretion. The structural analysis of new substances is now so routine that papers reporting one or two new compounds are rarely acceptable, unless other information on their properties or on the sources is included. The publication of known compounds with potentially important bioactivity or detailed spectroscopic investigations will be considered.<br />    
  
<div align="right"><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></div><br />
<div class="paraHead">Preparation of manuscripts:</div><br />
In order to achieve uniform presentation and to avoid unnecessary delays because of further inquiries, all authors are urged to observe the following guidelines.<br /><br />
                    <div class="paraHead">
                        Templates:</div><br />
<div align="left"><a href="./content/NPC-Template-2017.dotx">NPC Template</a></div><br />                        
Authors are strongly encouraged to use templates for the preparation of manuscripts. The template offers the authors many features that ease manuscript preparation and submission; all graphics and Tables can be integrated into the manuscript where author wishes to place them. Morover, the use of templates allow authors to view their paper in a style close to the final printed form. All manuscripts will be fully typeset from the author’s electronic files. It should be noted that due to defined typesetting standards and the complex requirements of electronic publishing, the Publisher will not always be able to exactly match the layout the author has submitted. The use of journal templates is preferable and its’ adoption will speed the publication process. To ensure successful use of template, author should save the final document as word file with a '.doc' extension (rather than the '.dot' extension).<br /><br />

            <dd>
            Title : Concise and informative appearing at the top of page one should reflect the contents of the manuscript. First letters of all words should be capitalized except for conjunctions, articles and prepositions.<br /><br />

Author names and affiliations : Please provide fully spelled-out first name of each author and the addresses at which the research was performed. Indicate all affiliations with a lower-case superscript letter immediately after the author’s name and in front of appropriate address. Provide the full postal address of each affiliation, including the country name, and the email address of corresponding author.<br /><br />

Corresponding author: Please indicate the corresponding author with asterisk, who is willing to handle correspondence at all stages of refereeing, and publications, also-post publication. Ensure that telephone and fax numbers (with country and area code) are provided in addition to the email address and the complete postal address.<br /><br />
            </dd>
            <dt><span class="paraHead">Abstract:</span></dt>
            <dd>A concise abstract briefly stating the purpose of the research, major findings, and conclusions, should appear on the page.<br /><br /></dd>

            <dt><span class="paraHead">Keywords:</span></dt>
            <dd>At the end of textual abstract, authors are requested to provide a list (3-8) keywords which identify most important subjects covered in the manuscript.<br /><br /></dd>

            <dt><span class="paraHead">Main text:</span></dt>
            <dd>The manuscript should be written as clearly and concisely as possible. Common headings such as Introduction, Results and Discussion, and Conclusions should not be used as text within these sections should be self explanatory. Please avoid lengthy surveys of the literature, except when perspective (reviews) articles, are involved.
Tables must be created in word format and must have a title. Designate footnotes as a, b, c, etc. Number tables consecutively.<br /><br /></dd>

            <dt><span class="paraHead">Experimental:</span></dt>
            <dd>Typically this section should be divided into subsections, the contents of which varies according to the subject matter of the article. This must contain all the information to guarantee reproducibility. In an introductory paragraph, special equipment, etc. should be detailed. A precise workup containing all details, e.g., the amount of solvent used for extraction, details of chromatographic purifications and yields etc., should be given. Products yield should be given in terms of g or mol as well as in %.<br /><br />

Physical and spectroscopic data can be included in the experimental section or, in case that a large number of compounds are prepared, presented in tables. Spectroscopic data should be stated in the order and format shown in following example:<br /><br />




<div align="left"><a href="./content/PDFExample.pdf">PDF Example</a></div><br />

<sup>1</sup><b>H NMR</b>: Always give coupling constants for well resolved peaks. After each chemical shift, enter in parenthesis number of protons, multiplicity, coupling constants, and assignment in that order.<br /><br />
<sup>13</sup><b>C NMR</b>: Carbon-13 NMR data should be reported to the nearest 0.1 ppm with the number of attached hydrogens designated as CH<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>, CH and C notion.<br /><br />
Many types of data can be effectively presented in tabular form and authors are encouraged to do so. The title of the table should accurately and concisely describe the contents of the table.<br /><br />
            </dd>

            <dt><span class="paraHead">Acknowledgments:</span></dt>
            <dd>The inclusion of an acknowledgments section is optional. It may include credit to technical assistance, financial support and other appropriate recognition, and should be brief and placed after the experimental section.<br /><br /></dd>
           
            <dt><span class="paraHead">Figure legends, Tables, Figures, Schemes:</span></dt>
            <dd>Every graphic file requires a unique title and must be referred to in the text. Drawings can only be named Scheme, Figure, or Equation.<br /><br />
<b>Crystallographic Data:</b> Complete X-ray data will not be published. They should be deposited at an appropriate international data institute, which is then cited in a reference. If a representation of the crystal structure (e.g., ORTEP) is to be included, it should be accompanied by the following data:
    <ol>
        <li>formula</li>
        <li>crystal data</li>
        <li>method of collection</li>
        <li>methods of structure solution and refinement</li>
        <li>selected bond lengths and angles<br /><br /></li>
    </ol>
<b>Supplementary data:</b> NPC accepts electronic supplementary material to support and enhance scientific research. Therefore, spectral data all compounds should be included on separate sheets at the end of the manuscript which will be published online The presence of these files will be signified by a footnote to the article title, and by a description included in a "Supplementary data" section at the end of the paper.<br /><br /></dd>
            <dt><span class="paraHead">References:</span></dt>
            <dd>References should be placed collectively after the acknowledgments section and numbered consecutively. Authors are encouraged to list all relevant references and cite extensively. Each reference may have its own citation number, or alternatively, reference referring to the same topic may be grouped under a common number but separated as (a), (b) (c) etc. List all authors; including diacritical marks (umlaut, acute accent, etc.) when these appear in original. Responsibility for the accuracy of bibliographic citations lies entirely with authors. Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the reference list (and vice versa). Unpublished results and personal communications should not be in the reference list, but may be mentioned in the text. Citation of a reference as “in press” implies that the item has been accepted for publication. Indicate references by number(s) in square brackets in line with text. The actual authors can be referred to, but the reference number (s) must always be given.<br /><br />

                                	<b>Natural Product Communications</b> (<i>NPC</i>), launched in March 2006, provides a major venue for rapid publication of high quality natural products research, including organic, medicinal, pharmaceutical, bioorganic, analytical, theoretical, biotechnological and chemotaxonomic aspects. We are delighted that <i>NPC</i> has made such a good start and has attracted the attention of scientists world wide, as indicated by the web statistics. This has only been possible due to the large number of high quality submissions and the tremendous efforts of the reviewers. We are very grateful to all the authors who have submitted such high quality work to the journal and the reviewers for dealing with the manuscripts so rapidly.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    During 2006, we have had two honorarium issues and one thematic one, on alkaloids. The November issue was in honor of the 65th birthday of Professor Dr Eckhard Wollenweber, an internationally renowned natural product researcher, and the December issue was dedicated to the memory of Professor Dr Ivano Morelli, who was an inspiration to scientists, young and old, and who played a key role in the development of phytochemical research, not only in Italy, but also in the international arena. We should like to thank all the authors who contributed such high quality papers for these issues and the reviewers, all of who responded to such a short and challenging timetable. We are pleased to mention that <i>NPC</i> will be proud to recognize other eminent scientists by dedicating an issue in honor of them, and suggestions from the natural products community will be welcomed.
                                </p>
                                <p>We are committed to placing this journal at the forefront for the dissemination of novel and exciting natural products research. We should like to remind our prospective authors that <i>NPC</i> does not restrict them with page limitation, although we strongly encourage them to present their results in an even number of pages. Technical details of lesser priority should preferably be included in ‘Supporting Information’ rather than in the main text. We look forward to receiving your submissions and to having your feedback.
                                </p>
                                <p>We should like to announce some changes to the Editorial Board and Editorial Board of Advisors for 2007. Professors Daneel Ferreira and Hyeong-Kyu Lee have had to step down for personal reasons. Their commitment and expertise will be missed, and on behalf of both the Editors and publisher, we thank them for their support. We are, however, pleased to report that as of January 2007, Professors Yoshinori Asakawa, Erminio Murano, Om Prakash, William Setzer and Peter Waterman will join the Editorial Advisory Board of <i>NPC</i>. Professor Stephen Pyne, who has served on this Advisory Board for the first year, will be joining the Editorial Board, bringing considerable expertise and experience in synthetic aspects of natural products chemistry. We welcome them all and look forward to working with them.
                                </p>
                                <p>It has been extremely gratifying for the Editorial Board members, all leading scientists
                                in various fields of natural products, to experience such an enthusiastic response from the
                                community of natural product researchers on numerous occasions in recent months regarding
                                this new initiative. We should also like to thank all the authors who have taken up our
                                invitation to submit some of their best work to the journal.
                                </p>
